Ektron_jQuery_Accordion_Menu
============================

Ektron CMS vertical accordion menu using MenuView Control and TreeFilter template<br />
<br /> Date created: July 10, 2014<br />
I created a vertical accordion nav menu for the site I'm working on cityofracine.org. I created it from scratch<br />
using jQuery UI, a custom Css, and used the TreeFilter Model Template available in the new Ektron API.<br />
I chose to use jquery instead of bootstrap or pure CSS3 because some of my users still use IE 8 and I wanted<br />
the behaviors to work in older browsers. Man, I love jquery! Stay tuned for more tweaks and another jquery menu<br />
code snippet for Ektron like the slider panel menu Facebook uses on mobile devices. It's looking pretty cool so far!
